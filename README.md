## 💡 Highlights:
 - **Tech used:** C++, Docker
 - Dynamic memory allocation system
 - Mountable Virtual File System with per-process file tables
 - Linux kernel subsystems

## ℹ️ Overview:
This operating system was built as a semester-long project for the Harvard course CS1610. The operating system currently functions by repeatedly forking processes, running them, and exiting them all whilst managing virtual and physical memory.

### About the Author
Hello! I'm Caleb, the creator of this repository. This was my first major look into systems development and is my largest project to date. Building this project was immensely difficult but massively rewarding.
Building this OS kernel fundamentally changed the way that I approach programming and gave me a view into a world unlike any other with systems development.
